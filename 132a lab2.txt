Which battleships launched before 1930 had 16-inch guns? List their names, their country, and the number of guns they carried.

SELECT name,country,numGuns
FROM Ships
WHERE yearLaunched < 1930 and gunSize = 16;

Which battleship(s) had the guns with the largest gun size?

SELECT name
FROM Ships
WHERE gunSize NOT IN 
   (SELECT s.gunSize
    FROM Ships s,Ships f
    WHERE s.gunSize < f.gunSize)

Which battleships had the guns with the second largest gun size. More precisely, find the ships whose gun size was exceeded by only one gun size, no matter how many other ships had that larger gun size. List the names of the ships and their gun size.

Select name, gunSize 
from ships
where gunSize=(
  select max(gunSize) as SecondBiggest

      select max(gunSize) as Biggest

List, for each country, the average number of guns carried by their battleships.

List all the pairs of countries that fought each other in battles. List each pair only once, and list them with the country that comes first in alphabetical order first.

SELECT DISTINCT s1.country, s2.country
FROM battles b1
JOIN ships s1
ON s1.name = b1.ship

ORDER BY s1.country, s2.country

For the battle of Surigao Strait, for each country engaged in that battle (had one or more battleships participating), give the number of its battleships that were sunk. Note: this question is very tricky. In particular, you need to deal with the (historical) case that a country engaged in the battle but did not have any ships sunk.

SELECT country,SUM(CASE WHEN result = 'sunk' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS TotalShipSunk 
FROM ships 
INNER JOIN battles 
      ON ships.name=battles.ship 
WHERE battleName='Surigao Strait'
GROUP BY country
