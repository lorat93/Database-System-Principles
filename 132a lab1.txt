Consider the following database schema for a BOOKSTORE database:
•	Books (bookid, title, author, year)
•	Customers (customerid, name, email)
•	Purchases (customerid, bookid, year)
•	Reviews (customerid, bookid, rating)
•	Pricing (bookid, format, price)

E.G
Books(105, 'JAVA PROGRAMMING', 'JOHN DOE', 2001)
Customers(210, 'JOHN SMITH', 'SMITH@YAHOO.COM')
Purchases(210, 105, 2002)
Reviews(210, 105, 3)
Pricing(105, 'AUDIO', 25)

1.	Find books (show their titles) written by 'EDMUND MORGAN' since year 1990.

SELECT title
FROM Books
WHERE author = "EDMUND MORGAN" AND
      year > 1989;

2.	Find books (show their titles, authors and prices) that are on 'CIVIL WAR' (i.e., the title field contains 'CIVIL WAR'), available in 'AUDIO' format.

SELECT b.title, b.author, p.price
FROM BOOKS b
INNER JOIN PRICING p ON p.bookid = b.bookid 
WHERE b.title like '%CIVIL WAR%' 
AND p.format like '%AUDIO%' group by b.title

3.	For each year, 'JOHN CHAMBERS' purchased at least one book, find the number of books purchased. That is, the output should be a set of tuples, each indicating a year and the number of books purchased by 'JOHN CHAMBERS' in that year.

select purchases.year, count(*) as numBooks 
from books, customers, purchases 
where purchases.bookid = books.bookid and purchases.customerid = customers.customerid and customers.name = 'JOHN CHAMBERS' 
group by year 
having count(*) > 0 

4.	Find customers (show their names and email addresses) who purchased more than one book in year 2003.

SELECT name, email
FROM Customers c
INNER JOIN Purchases p ON c.customerId = p.customerId
WHERE p.year = 2003
GROUP BY name, email
HAVING COUNT(p.customerId) > 1;

5.	Find the ratings information (show titles, authors and average ratings) for books on 'CIVIL WAR' (i.e., title contains 'CIVIL WAR').

SELECT b.title,b.author,AVG(r.rating)
FROM BOOKS b
INNER JOIN REVIEWS r ON r.bookid = b.bookid
WHERE b.title LIKE '%CIVIL WAR%'
GROUP BY b.title, b.author
